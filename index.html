   <p>I will write on this page about F1 sport. I will be talking about the most know drivers and teams in the sport.
   </p>
   <hr/>
   <p>Formula 1 is the most know racing sport in the world, It contain the fastest and best drivers in the globe. 
    It is intense and need highly trained professional drivers that can fight all the Gforce<sup>1</sup> for over an hour of continuous racing</p>
    <p>Formula 1 cars are the <em>best</em> and <em>most expensive</em> for a reason. these cars cost over 10 million USD. the reason for these prices is how perefctly engineered they are.</p>
    <p>They are called Formula 1 for a reason. the cars are built on standards and need to be followed strictly. for an example
        the fuel used in the F1 cars need to be 10% ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH), that is because the F1 industry is heading for 100% sustainability (0% carbon emmisions)
    </p>
    <p>Formula 1 races are held in multiple countries one of them is <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>. for three seaons now Jeddah has be one of the most successful grandprixs<sup>2</sup> in the calendar.
    Our track in Jeddah is the fastest street track in the world and that what makes it unique and competitive for F1 drivers.
    As from what I saw from the driveres, they all enjoy the track because of the pace it provides.</p>
    <p>Two of the most know and successful drivers recently are <span>Max Verstapen </span>and, <span>Lewis Hamilton</span>. Lewis Hamilton has been dominating the championship in the past 10 seasons, but Max Verstapin came to strip his dominance in the past three seasons</p>

    <h1>F1 Teams</h1>
    <h2>Top teams</h2>
    <p>Every era has some teams that dominate the show. this era has Redbull, and Mercedes that crushed the championship. That doesn't mean other teams doesn't win at all, but at the end the two previous teams dominate the most wins.</p>
    <h2>Teams</h2>
    <h3>Redbull</h3>
    <p>Red Bull Racing, currently competing as Oracle Red Bull Racing and also known simply as Red Bull or RBR, is a Formula One racing team, racing under an Austrian licence and based in the United Kingdom. It is one of two Formula One teams owned by conglomerate Red Bull GmbH, 
        the other being Scuderia AlphaTauri. The Red Bull Racing team has been managed by Christian Horner since its formation in 2005.</p>
    <h3>Mercedes</h3>
    <p>Mercedes-Benz, a brand of the Mercedes-Benz Group, has been involved in Formula One as both team owner and engine manufacturer for various periods since 1954.
         The current Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team is based in Brackley, England, and possesses a German licence. An announcement was made in December 2020
         that Ineos planned to take a one third equal ownership stake alongside the Mercedes-Benz Group and Toto Wolff; this came into effect on 25 January 2022. Mercedes-branded teams are often referred to by the nickname, the "Silver Arrows".</p>
    <h2>Must mention</h2>
    <p>Ferrari, Aston Martin, and Alpine are also big F1 competitors that worth to mention.
        Ferrari is for sure one of the top three F1 teams. one day it was Michael Schumacher's team the most know driver in the world!
        even though they are facing some troubles over the past years, still the Italians will be one of the best.
